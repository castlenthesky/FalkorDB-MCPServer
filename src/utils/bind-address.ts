/**
 * Determine whether a bind-address value (as set via MCP_BIND_ADDRESS) refers
 * to a loopback interface — i.e. one that is not reachable from outside the
 * host it's running on.
 *
 * Accepts:
 *  - unset/empty (treated as "not opted in", so it's safe)
 *  - `127.0.0.0/8` in either bracketed or unbracketed form
 *  - `::1`, bracketed as `[::1]` or not (Docker Compose's `host_ip` accepts both)
 *  - IPv4-mapped loopback, e.g. `::ffff:127.0.0.1`
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT special-case `localhost`: Docker Compose rejects it
 * outright as an invalid `host_ip` before the container ever starts, so
 * accepting it here would just invite unverifiable hostname assumptions.
 *
 * Everything else — including `0.0.0.0`, `::`, and any LAN/public address —
 * is treated as non-local (fails closed).
 *
 * @param value The raw MCP_BIND_ADDRESS value.
 * @returns true if the value is a loopback address (or unset).
